In Spring 2023, as part of the Edmonds College Physics Department, I completed a quarter-long undergraduate research project exploring the quantum properties of optical information channels. I was curious if there was a point when information loss would become indistinguishable from detection of an eavesdropper. At the distances I was able to test, I found minimal information loss without the presence of an observer indicating these are stable distances for transmission. To further explore this line of research I would need a different set of equipment. I created a poster to present my findings at the Edmonds College Undergraduate Research Symposium in June of 2023. A final research paper typeset with LaTeX provided a detailed outline of the methodology, findings, and data.

The project involved implementing the [BB-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84) cryptographic protocol by programming an Arduino UNO to control a laser diode and sensor.
