Welcome to my portfolio site. 

- [Projects](blog/) contains information about my work in a completed or semi-completed state. 
- [Repositories](repositories/) contains links to my favorite projects source code.  

I am currently studying a M.S. in Quantum Information Science at the University of Southern California. I previously graduated
with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Vermont, and an A.A. in Computer Science from Edmonds College. 

My interests lie in quantum computing, distributed computing, networking, and [realtime graphical programming.](blog/2023/chladni_plate_simulation)

Some of my projects include development of an [efficient weighted sampling data structure](https://github.com/Didgety/samplableset-rs), [DNS server](/blog/2023/dns_server/), and [roguelike videogame](blog/2023/rusted_rogue/) using Rust.

My quantum computing journey began in Spring 2023 when I completed an [undergraduate research project](/blog/2023/qkd_research_project) exploring eavesdropping detection and error rates in optical networks as part of the Edmonds College Physics Department.

I spent the Summer of 2024 studying quantum information science at Brookhaven and Oak Ridge national labs.

In Spring 2025 I created a [framework](https://github.com/Didgety/qpgf) for analyzing the distribution of errors in quantum circuits 
given real hardware data by utilizing probability generating functions as a final project for a complex systems class.

Most recently, I have been [contributing](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/14827) to the open-source [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) project.

Previously, I have worked in IT support where I developed automation tools and infrastructure in addition to handling regular support tickets (2021 - 2022). My position required lots of network debugging and use of REST API's.

In my free time I enjoy creating realtime generative artworks, getting out in nature, winter sports, going to concerts, and trying new foods.
